# README #

Experimentation and testing with air pollutants data.
Repo originally in Spanish language. Only readme file has been translated.
This is a work in progress (paused at the moment).

## Objectives

* Scrape and wrangle data from the official Chilean government air quality monitoring-system.
* Experiment with gathered data (pattern discovery, exploration).

## Methodological notes

* Data was originally stored in a relational data base. Now it needs to be stored in a file. Code updating is not finished. Today this repo is sort of a old/new code mixture.
* Acquiring the whole historic data may take several hours to complete.

## Some ideas to do next ##

* Update code to perform datum category update (preliminar and not validated) for historic data.
* Create visualisations for basic analysis.
